This code is for generating inlet conditions for LES, DES, etc. It is based on the Synthetic eddy method, with the full algorithm described in:

The file U, in this directory, shows how the SEM should be set up. There are three user inputs. UIn is the prescribed mean velocity at the inlet. RIn is the prescribed Reynolds stress tensor at the inlet. Sigma is the prescribed lengthscale of the turbulence.

Sigma can usually be estimated from engineering judgement, or a prior RANS calculation as k^{3/2} / epsilon, where k and epsilon are the turbulent kinetic energy, and dissipation rate respectively. For an anisotropic length-scale, a RSM closure can be used, with sigma being set to (uu^{3/2}/epsilon, vv^{3/2}/epsilon, ww^{3/2}/epsilon). In any case, it is important to manually clip the lengthscale returned by this estimate to prevent excessively small or large eddies. For example, eddies should not be smaller than the local LES filter width, or maximum cell dimension. Eddies should also not be larger than the geometry for internal flows (typically, for a channel flow, sigma < 0.4 delta seems to work well).

This code has been tested on OpenFOAM 1806, but may work on other versions.
